# TopCountriesMilitarySpending

The beginning of this research was prompted by the threat of global conflict that has existed since Russia's incursion into Ukraine.

This led me to want to analyze and understand how the military spending of countries has worked in recent years, to understand if this has had an impact on the escalation of conflicts between major nations and how the world's leading power has behaved in this scenario.

This analysis is for educational purposes and to put into practice the skills acquired in the study of data science.
